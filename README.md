# APMA 2811X Lecture Notes
Lecture notes from **APMA 2811X: Finite Element Exterior Calculus** by Johnny Guzm√°n at Brown University for the Spring 2024 semester. The aim of the course is to cover the paper **Finite element exterior calculus: from Hodge theory to numerical stability** by Douglas N. Arnold, Richard S. Falk, Ragnar Winther.

**Update:** On April 1st 2025, I gave an introductory talk to the subject of finite element exterior calculus. The slides for the talk can be found [here](feec_talk.pdf).
